# This sample dic file describes a blank line, a comment line and a tail
# comment
#
# A blank line is below.  ... very void. :-)

# A comment line is me. It starts '#' or space.
 So I am a comment line too.
# These blank and comment lines are ignored.

# A tail comment is below.  You can write a comment at tail of entry.  a tail
# comment starts with/without '#'.  The former is picked up.  The latter is
# ignored.
あ	ア	亜	# picked up
あ	ア	亜	ignored

### Trivial rules for a tail comment.  It depend on spaces around '#'.

# valid entry: word_class: "亜",  comment: "コメント１"
あ	ア	亜 #コメント１
# valid entry: word_class: "亜#", comment: nil
あ	ア	亜# コメント２
# valid entry: word_class: "亜#コメント３", comment: nil
あ	ア	亜#コメント３
